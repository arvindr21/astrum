> Copper Framework is a clone & update of [NoDivide/astrum](https://github.com/NoDivide/astrum). All the project setup &ninitial templates with pattern library was created by NoDivide. This is an attempt to covert the same to a Web component library.


Copper Framework is a lightweight component library designed to be included with any web project.

It's non-opinionated and doesn't expect you to write your markup or code in any particular way.

A CF component library comprises of components organised into groups. Each component has a `markup.html` and `description.md` file which are
used to render an example of the component along with a code sample. A group can also have an description and is used for organisational purposes.
You also have the option to add pages of content, for example an introduction page and/or coding guidelines specific to your project.
